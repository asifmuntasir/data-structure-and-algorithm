# How to measuring code efficiency?
Ans:
-----
-> Readability.
-> How much time it takes while running.

But we have so many ways to solving a specific problem. Like as
there has two program in below and our task is to find which 
one is better. Now what does mean about better? Is it---
- Faster in execution(Require is less time).
- Less memory-intensive(Requires in less memory). How much memory
it takes while execute.
- More Readable?


## BIG O
-----------

-> Hows the operations grows based on input?
    1. f(n) could be linear [f(n) = n].
    'Operation will increase/decrease with value of `n` rate'.
    2. f(n) could be quadratic [f(n) = n^2].
    'Operation will be double with the value of `n` rate'.
    3. f(n) could be constant [f(n) = n].
    'Operation will increase/decrease without depends on `n` rate'.
    4. f(n) could be logarithmic [f(n) = log(n)].
    5. f(n) could be loglinear [f(n) = nlog(n)].
    6. f(n) could be something entirely different.
    [It means programe can't be made any realtion with the 
    input decrease/increase value]
