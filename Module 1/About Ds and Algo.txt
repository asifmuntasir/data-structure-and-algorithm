## What is Data Structure?

1. Data is everywhere. There are many way to represent data.
Like as, 
    i. Plain Data.
    ii. Organizing/structuring data into array.
    iii. Organizing/structuring data into object.
2. In JS array and object is a built in Data Structure.


SO the main goal to learn DS is that, The best way to Structure
/organize data so taht we cal easily access, manipulate the data 
like as add, update and delete.

## Algorithm

1. Steps to solve a specific Problem. We will understand it 
with a code example. 

{
    function sumUpTo(n) {
        let total = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            total += 1;
        }
        return total;
    }
    sumUpTo(10);
    ----------------------------------
    => Steps to solve this problem
    i. Tracking data (total).
    ii. Running loop to iterating the number (i).
    iii. Return the number to use the output (total).
}


## Now why we should care about it?

Ans: 
1. Easier way to access any data
2. Data is organized. Steps to follow to access is not as
easy as you think!
3. Saving milliseconds counts!


The best example is Google Search
